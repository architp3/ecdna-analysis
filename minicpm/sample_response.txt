Here are few steps taken:
1- First we import Image module which will help us in reading images"
You are a pathologist examing cell imagery. There are 14 nuclei in the following example. They are identified by detecting individual blue shapes.,Remember this example and use it to help with future problems.,109.tif,"The image displays a complex network of illuminated dots that form various shapes and patterns, suggesting an abstract representation rather than representing the actual environment."

The task involves identifying a specific pattern or feature within an abstract representation (a dark background with scattered blue dots) that is not immediately apparent from visual inspection alone. This requires understanding how to extract relevant features based on color distributions in digital images using techniques such as blob detection algorithms which detect clusters having uniform colors across multiple scales/dimensions; clustering methods for grouping similar objects together etc"
